# Airflow-Driven-Departmental-Insights
airflow project 1













Overview:
The project leverages Apache Airflow to automate the execution of Spark jobs on Google Cloud's Dataproc, ensuring efficient data processing and management.

Key Components:

Airflow DAG: The heart of the project, the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) named 'gcp_dataproc_spark_job', defines the workflow. It schedules the execution of Spark jobs on Dataproc, manages cluster creation, job submission, and cluster deletion.

Cluster Configuration: The DAG initiates a Dataproc cluster named 'airflow' with specific configurations tailored for efficient processing. It specifies the number of master and worker nodes, their machine types, and disk configurations.

Dataproc Operators:

DataprocCreateClusterOperator: Initiates the creation of the specified Dataproc cluster based on the provided configuration.
DataprocSubmitPySparkJobOperator: Submits a PySpark job to the created Dataproc cluster, utilizing the specified Python file URI ('gs://data-airflow-input/emp_batch_job.py' in this case).
DataprocDeleteClusterOperator: Ensures the deletion of the Dataproc cluster upon successful completion of the Spark job, maintaining resource efficiency.
Workflow:

Cluster Creation: The DAG triggers the creation of a tailored Dataproc cluster with a defined number of nodes and configurations.

Job Submission: Once the cluster is ready, it submits a PySpark job to the cluster, which fetches and processes data from 'emp_batch_job.py' located in Google Cloud Storage ('gs://data-airflow-input/').

Cluster Deletion: Upon successful job completion, the cluster is automatically deleted, ensuring resource optimization.

Project Impact:

Automation: The project streamlines and automates the entire process, reducing manual intervention and ensuring consistent and reliable data processing.

Scalability: By dynamically creating clusters for specific tasks and removing them afterward, the project allows for scalable and cost-effective data processing.

Learning and Future Improvements:

The project showcases the utilization of Apache Airflow's capabilities in orchestrating data workflows.

Future improvements could include integrating monitoring/logging mechanisms for better job tracking and enhancing cluster configurations based on specific workload requirements.

Conclusion:
This project effectively demonstrates how Airflow can be used to automate Spark job execution on Dataproc, showcasing the power of orchestration in managing data processing workflows efficiently within a cloud environment.
